    "Description": "Polyrhythm is Perfume's fifth major label single, and tenth overall. Although the sales for \"Fan Service: sweet\" were not stellar, \"Chocolate Disco\" did catch the attention of an already well-established artist in the J-pop industry, Kimura Kaela. Kimura then played Perfume's music on her radio show consistently. While listening to Kimura's radio show, a commercial director named Akira Tomotsugi noticed Perfume and decided to use the three girls in an upcoming TV ad. On July 1, 2007, the commercial for NHK's national recycling campaign aired, featuring Perfume and a new song, \"Polyrhythm\". The commercial gave Perfume exposure they could have only dreamed of before. Subsequently, their next live show sold out",
